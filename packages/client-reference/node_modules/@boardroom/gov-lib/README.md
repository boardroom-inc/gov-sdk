# gov-lib

This package contains all of the core logic and types for the Governance SDK. It is used by protocol packages to define the integrations and adapters required to connect a protocol to the Governance SDK.

No protocol-specific logic will live in this package, it is strictly the framework and utilities used by the rest of the stack.
